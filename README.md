# AI Assistant Impact On Student Success
## Project Overview
&nbsp; Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been evolving rapidly in recent years, enabling machines to perform wide range of human tasks from simple to highly complex task. One primary reason AI gaining traction because of its efficiency in handling repetitive and routine tasks without requiring extensive resources. These capabilities have positioned AI as a higly valuable solution across various industries including education. In the context of higher education, AI-powered assistant are becoming encreasingly significant in supporting students throughout their academic journey.

&nbsp; With the growing reliance on digital learning environments, students often encounter difficulties in understanding complex concepts. AI assistant such as ChatGPT, Google Bard, and IBM Granite are developed to address this gap by delivering immediate responses, simplifying difficult topics, and offering consistent feedback without the need for human tutors. This level of accessibility and responsiveness has the potential to significantly enhance students’ academic performance and overall learning experience (Luckin et al., 2016). IBM Granite, in particular, represents an open, enterprise-grade AI model that focuses on instruction-following capabilities, enabling structured, educationally relevant interactions for academic environments.

&nbsp; To examine the impact of AI assistants on student success, this project establishes an evaluation framework designed to analyze their effectiveness in academic contexts. The study adopts a quantitative approach involving the collection and analysis of survey data, academic performance records, and interaction frequencies with AI platforms. Statistical methods such as linear regression and correlation are used to determine the relationship between AI usage and academic outcomes. Key indicators examined include improvements in material comprehension, study efficiency, and student achievement (Woolf et al., 2013; Holmes et al., 2019)

&nbsp; This system is developed to provide educational institutions with valuable insights into the integration of AI technologies in teaching and learning processes. By identifying both the advantages and potential limitations of AI-assisted learning, institutions can formulate strategies for effective and sustainable implementation. The ultimate objective is to utilize AI to foster personalized education, support independent learning, and contribute to long-term academic success.
